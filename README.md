# Running in Docker container
To run the test execute download the repo and execute following commands


```docker
cd westwingwditests
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

In order to be able to run more tests this command can be modified to run suites or can be replaced with "npm test" to run all the available tests.

# Note
Currently running the test withing the docker container is giving an issue with chromedriver probably due to some configuration issues.
